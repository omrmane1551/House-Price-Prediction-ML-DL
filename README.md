# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts house prices based on features such as number of bedrooms, location, and income using the California Housing Dataset. It demonstrates an end-to-end workflow with traditional machine learning (Linear Regression) and deep learning (Neural Networks).

## Dataset
- **Source:** California Housing Dataset from Scikit-learn.
- The dataset includes features like average rooms, population, median income, housing age, and the target is the median house price.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Model training and evaluation with:
  - Linear Regression (ML)
  - Neural Network (DL)
- Performance comparison and result visualization

## How to Run
You can run the project notebook locally or on Google Colab:

### **Google Colab:**
- Open the notebook by uploading to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or directly link GitHub notebook URL.
- Run each cell sequentially.

### **Locally:**
1. Clone this repository:


3. Open the notebook (`house_price_prediction.ipynb`) in Jupyter and run the cells.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow, keras

## Results
- Provides Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 scores for both models.
- Visualizes training loss and validation loss for the neural network.
